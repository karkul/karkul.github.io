Recently I have decided to build a new place where I keep my notes about my daily job and learning, so I decide use a simple mini blog based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and host it on [Github pages](http://pages.github.com).

> I hope any of this notes helps you to solve or learn about an specific topic that you're looking for...  

Thanks for read!
