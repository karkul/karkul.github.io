  Hey there! This another attempt to have my own web blog to store my daily notes.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

This template is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole).

Thanks for reading!
