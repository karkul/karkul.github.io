**System Administrator & Software Developer Engineer**

Hello, my name is **Ram&oacute;n Morales** from Mexico and this is a new attempt to have a place where store my daily notes as Sysadmin hopping they can be useful for someone else to learn or solve a concern related with one of the topics mentioned on it.

Currently I'm working in an important **Openstack** project and I'm trying to keep all the knowledge acquired during its implementation.

<blockquote>
I made this because I really believe that the knowledge is to be shared, if not it simply will lose.
</blockquote>

Also you can find me on [Linkedin](https://mx.linkedin.com/in/rmoralesl) if you want to know more about my career path.

Well thanks for reading!
